# Results Documentation

This document is dedicated only to generated project results. It explains what the pipeline writes, where outputs are stored, what each result means, and how figures should be interpreted.

## Results Root

All generated outputs are under:

```text
results/
```

The directory is ignored by Git except for `.gitkeep`, so result sets should be archived separately when they are important for a report or release.

| Axes | X: `alpha` in degrees. Y: `CL/CD`. |
| Purpose | Diagnostic and comparison. |
| Interpretation | The peak indicates the most efficient 2D operating incidence for that case. |
| Limitations | Raw XFOIL result before Stage 3 compressibility corrections. Low-alpha artifacts may still exist. |

#### `cl_alpha_stall.png`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Path pattern | `results/stage2_xfoil_simulations/simulation_plots/{flight}/{section}/cl_alpha_stall.png` |

| Visual content | `CL` versus `alpha`, with maximum lift and stall-onset marker. |
| Axes | X: `alpha` in degrees. Y: `CL`. |
| Purpose | Stall-margin diagnostic. |
| Interpretation | The marked point indicates the detected maximum lift in the positive-alpha range. |
| Limitations | Stall detection comes from XFOIL polar behavior, not wind-tunnel validation. |

#### `polar_plot.png`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Path pattern | `results/stage2_xfoil_simulations/simulation_plots/{flight}/{section}/polar_plot.png` |
| Generated in | `stage2_xfoil_simulations/final_analysis_service.py`, `_plot_all()` |

| Visual content | Grouped bars of required blade pitch angle `beta` by flight condition and section. |
| Purpose | Kinematic comparison and VPF requirement estimate. |
| Interpretation | Larger spread in `beta` means greater pitch actuation range is needed. |
| Limitations | Uses Stage 2 2D optima; Stage 5 later refines with 3D corrections. |

#### `alpha_opt_evolution.png`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Path | `results/stage2_xfoil_simulations/pitch_map/alpha_opt_evolution.png` |

| Data used | `alpha_eff_map` from Stage 2. |
| Visual content | `alpha_opt` across flight phases, one line per blade section. |
| Purpose | Diagnostic and VPF motivation. |
| Interpretation | If optimal incidence changes with flight phase, fixed pitch is off-design outside cruise. |
| Limitations | Based on raw XFOIL polars before compressibility and 3D corrections. |

#### `vpf_efficiency_{section}.png`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Path pattern | `results/stage2_xfoil_simulations/pitch_map/vpf_efficiency_root.png`, `vpf_efficiency_mid_span.png`, `vpf_efficiency_tip.png` |

| Path | `results/stage2_xfoil_simulations/pitch_map/vpf_clcd_penalty.png` |
| Generated in | `stage2_xfoil_simulations/pitch_map.py`, `plot_vpf_clcd_penalty()` |
| Data used | Stage 2 polars and cruise `alpha_opt` reference. |
| Visual content | Two panels: absolute `CL/CD` for VPF vs fixed pitch, and retained efficiency percentage. |
| Purpose | Comparison and presentation. |
| Interpretation | Values below 100 percent retained efficiency indicate loss from using cruise pitch outside cruise. |

| Purpose | GE9X parametric validation and presentation. |
| Interpretation | Moving right of the reference `CL/CD` increases predicted fuel saving. |
| Limitations | Parametric model uses simplified transfer from aerodynamic efficiency to fuel saving. |

|---|---|
| Path | `results/stage7_sfc_analysis/figures/sfc_sensitivity_k_throttle.png` |
| Generated in | `stage7_sfc_analysis/engine/ge9x_analysis.py`, `_plot_sensitivity()` |
| Data used | GE9X `CL/CD` sweep and several `k_throttle` variants. |
| Visual content | Fuel saving versus `CL/CD` for different part-power SFC sensitivity coefficients. |
| Purpose | Sensitivity analysis. |
| Interpretation | Spread between curves shows uncertainty due to throttle/SFC modeling. |
| Limitations | `k_throttle` values are model parameters, not directly calibrated in this repository. |

## Additional Sensitivity Results

### Table: `sensitivity_table.csv`

Path: `results/sensitivity/sensitivity_table.csv`

Columns:

- `rpm_delta_pct`: fan RPM deviation from design point.
- `tau`: profile efficiency transfer coefficient.
- `sfc_reduction_pct`: mean predicted SFC reduction.

Current detected range: approximately 0.6192% to 3.8462% SFC reduction across the sweep.

### Figure: `sensitivity_heatmap.png`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Path | `results/sensitivity/sensitivity_heatmap.png` |
| Generated in | `run_sensitivity.py` |
| Data used | `sensitivity_table.csv` pivoted by `tau` and RPM deviation. |
| Visual content | Heatmap of `Delta SFC (%)` as a function of `tau` and RPM deviation. |
| Purpose | Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. |
| Interpretation | Higher cells show parameter regions with stronger predicted SFC reduction. |
| Limitations | Uses existing Stage 3 and Stage 4 data; it does not rerun XFOIL or compressibility corrections for new RPM values. |

## Recommendations for Output Interpretation

1. Start with `finalresults_stage*.txt` to understand whether each stage completed and what headline values were produced.
2. Use Stage 2 plots to inspect raw XFOIL convergence behavior and polar quality.
3. Use Stage 3 plots before trusting corrected metrics, especially at high Mach.
4. Treat Stage 4 `summary_table.csv` as the central aerodynamic performance table.
5. Treat Stage 5 as the bridge from 2D corrected polar behavior to fan-relevant pitch and loading behavior.
6. Treat Stage 6 as a mechanism-weight trade study, not a validated aerodynamic reverse-thrust prediction.
7. Treat Stage 7 SFC numbers as model-based estimates controlled by `tau`, physical caps, and mission assumptions.
8. Archive result sets externally before rerunning the full pipeline.
