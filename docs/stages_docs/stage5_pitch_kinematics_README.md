# Stage 5 README - Pitch Kinematics and 3D Fan Analysis

## Purpose of This Stage

Stage 5 extends the 2D corrected polar analysis toward fan-relevant 3D behavior. It adds cascade effects, rotational lift corrections, 3D optimum incidence, pitch kinematics, blade twist, single-actuator compromise, and stage loading.

This stage answers: **how do the corrected 2D airfoil results translate into blade pitch, twist, radial loading, and 3D fan-section behavior?**

The root section receives the strongest modeled rotational lift correction because `c/r` is largest there.

## Figure Interpretation

It demonstrates:

- root has high solidity;
- tip has lower solidity;
- cascade effects are not uniform along the blade span.

## Important Considerations

- Stage 5 is where the analysis moves beyond isolated 2D airfoil behavior.
- Snel and Du-Selig corrections are empirical and should be treated as model estimates.
- Current analysis uses three representative radial sections.
- The single-actuator model is a simplification of real VPF mechanical architecture.

## Model Restrictions

| Restriction | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Empirical 3D corrections | Snel and Du-Selig are not equivalent to CFD or rig data. |
| Simplified cascade model | Weinig and Carter provide engineering approximations. |
| Three radial stations | No continuous radial integration. |
| Simplified actuator model | Real mechanisms may have structural, control, and nonlinear limits. |
| Stage loading reference zone | The fixed-pitch design zone is diagnostic, not an absolute pass/fail criterion. |

## Downstream Role

Stage 5 outputs are used by Stage 7 to improve SFC calculations with kinematic and 3D context.
